description: This is a project to create propaganda posters for API specifications. It would be nice to have motivational and inspirational posters that help folks get behind API specifications for meaningful purposes. Like other projects we are using Github to manage efforts around this work, and if you want to get involved feel free to submit a Github issue or send email to info@apievangelist.com.
