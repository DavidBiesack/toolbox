name: Quantifying Scope of API Specification Community
slug: quantifying-scope-of-api-specification-community
description: It can be tough to understand the scope of how API specifications are used. When on-boarding new users to the concept of OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or AsyncAPI, I often get asked about how big the OpenAPI or other community is, and I don't have any solid numbers on the scope of it even though I know it is big. This is a project to help quantify the scope of OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman Collections, while also defining the process for how we quantify the scope and what metrics we use.
