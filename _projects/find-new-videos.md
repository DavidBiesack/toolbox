description: We need to spend a regular amount of time keeping an eye out for interesting videos about API specifications and aggregate them here, tagging and organizing them so people can tune in. This work is all being managed via a single GitHub repository, with an overview of the work on the README, and the discussion around individual tools and other tasks conducted via GitHub issues.
