description: The OpenAPI Specification, formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is a standard, machine-readable format for REST-style API definitions and documentation. Swagger 2.0 introduced vendor extensions, which allow certain objects to have properties named with an x- prefix, with arbitrary or independently specified property values. Vendor extensions were later renamed to specification extensions in OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.
