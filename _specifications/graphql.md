description: <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling
  those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable
  description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly
  what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables
  powerful developer tools.</p>
