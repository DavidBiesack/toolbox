name: Postman MeteorJs
description: The Postman chrome plugin is a cool application. The problem is when
  you sync your collections, you don't own your data, so it's no more cool. The aim
  of the project is to allow every one to get the same cool app, but that can be installed
  on it's own server, so you own your datas.
