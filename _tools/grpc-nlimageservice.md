description: An image server client architecture using gRPC, Protobuf, CMake and C++14.
  The client requests the server to rotate an input image, and also to transform an
  input image into an oil-painting. The server fulfills the client's requests and
  sends back the requested output to the client. All message transmissions are made
  as protobuf serialized bytes.
