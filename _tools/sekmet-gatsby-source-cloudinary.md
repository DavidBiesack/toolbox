name: sekmet gatsby source cloudinary
description: Source plugin for pulling assets into Gatsby from Cloudinary.  It creates
  links between entry types and asset so they can be queried in Gatsby using GraphQL
  and creates ImageSharp nodes from your cloudinary image files that are supported
  by the Sharp image processing library and provides fields in their GraphQL types
  for processing your images in a variety of ways including resizing, cropping, and
  creating responsive images.
