description: "Summary Create management portal and Web API (referred as GLvNext API
  below) to serve retail offers for mobile and SPA clients.  Details Offers should
  be  created locally via admin portal by merchants and  additionally, sourced from
  various remote APIs all available for consumption via the new GLvNext API for mobile
  / SPA clients. Offer (served via API) must have fields Title Description Please
  introduce more fields you consider required for Offer to be useable.  Offer example:
  \ Title: \u201CGet 20% discount for purchases over $100 from selected merchants
  this Valentine day\u201D Description: \u201CLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
  adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
  ex ea commodo consequat\u201D Considerations: Admin portal authentication/authorisation
  can be mocked and not required to be fully implemented at this stage or focused
  at; Initial focus should be on backend and Web API implementation rather than front-end
  and UI/UX; No user login required to use GLvNext API; Please show usage of HttpClient
  in the solution; The system should be able to handle high load especially on API
  side but also handle possible large datasets coming from external sources, consider
  that this might be a part of large system and integrating with multiple data providers;
  \ Choice of frontend stack is not important (we usually do standard ASP.net Core
  MVC, jquery or vue.js rather than SPA type of web apps)  Backend stack preferably
  .NET Core, any version 2.1 to 3.1;  Use Azure stack if familiar; Data persistence
  / ORM, the choice is yours, preference would be MS SQL and EF Core; Remote API to
  Consume Remote Offers API details: https://2d976b39.azurewebsites.net/v1/offers

  8B5A92FC-CA0F-4920-9358-50D2EE74A716 Gl-AppKey: FB Feel free to ask questions about
  this API during the test. To-Do  Provide the following Approximate estimate in hours/days;
  High level breakdown of tasks to do; Next, you are required to set up the solution
  and start implementation. You are not expected to complete this within given 2 hours,
  so this is not a speed/stress test, simply work in your normal pace, the way you
  would usually do on a project. Please, submit your work either by zipping the solution
  up and sharing (dropbox etc.) or via GitHub, GitLab, Azure devops etc. Any clarification
  and questions are most welcome either via skype or email. Skype: pavel.orlov000
  Email: pavel@globalloyalty.com  Bonus Task A bit of refactoring, please spend 15
  min to review and submit PR with a few initial changes you recommend here if any.
  If you think it needs to be refactored further, put your ideas in the description
  of the PR. https://github.com/jack0fshad0ws/Interview-Quiz/blob/master/GL.FileParser/Class1.cs"
