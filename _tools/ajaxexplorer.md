name: AjaxExplorer
description: The Super Endpoint Explorer (SEE) app will allow the end user to craft
  requests to a remote end-point by filling out various form fields, send the request
  and show the response, and save common request configurations for later playback.
  The form of the tool is roughly like the Chrome Extension called Postman or an OSX
  HTTP exploration like Paw but obviously less polished and feature laden.
