name: Google API Improvement Proposals (AIP)
slug: google-api-improvement-proposals
description: AIP stands for API Improvement Proposal, which is a design document providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. The goal is for these documents to serve as the source of truth for API-related documentation at Google and the way API teams discuss and come to consensus on API guidance. The program is named and styled after Python's enhancement proposals (PEPs) which have seemed to work pretty well over the years.
