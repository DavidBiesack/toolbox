name: In need of Senior Front End Dev
description: An extremely exciting opportunity has materialised for a senior front-end
  developer to make their mark, work with the latest front-end technologies and be
  the lead in an equally exciting transformation.  My client is a fintech company,
  looking for two senior front-end developers to join their team and develop the next
  generation of responsive websites, progressive web apps and mobile apps using the
  latest front-end technologies.  My client currently develops web and mobile applications
  for two financial services products.   Their front-end technology stack is evolving
  from a legacy of Python/Django towards the latest web technologies.  They are using
  AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3 and AMP to create more robust pages and a better user experience.  The
  front-end developers will work closely with the UI Design, UX and Marketing teams
  in London and the offshore development team in Chennai to create the next generation
  of progressive web and mobile apps.  They are planning a migration to React, React
  Native, GraphQL, Node.js and websockets as their next generation technologies, as
  they sunset Python/Django.  Proof of concept projects are currently in progress.    They
  are focused on test automation and creating a continuous integration pipeline across
  their product suite.  Familiarity with C.I. and test tools Karma, Jasmine, gulp.js
  and Grunt are highly desirable.    Developers will have the opportunity to work
  in both web and mobile front-end development.
