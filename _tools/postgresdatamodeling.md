description: 'This purpose of setting up this database is to allow the users of **Sparkify(music
  streaming startup)** to be able to easily query data to achieve their analytic goals.
  As the data currently resides as a bundle of json files, it is not well organized
  for fetching information for analytical purposes. Hence using this data in the json
  files and organizing it as star schema would make it a lot easier for querying purposes.
  ***Hence this project involves designing a star schema, defining fact and dimension
  tables, building an ETL pipeling to autonmate the table loading process from source
  to target. This database is built in postgres and uses python for ETL pipeline.***
  This database will be tested against some sql queries provided by the analytics
  team. '
