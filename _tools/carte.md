description: <p>Carte is a simple Jekyll based documentation website for APIs. It
  is designed as a boilerplate to build your own documentation and is heavily inspired
  from Swagger and I/O docs. Fork it, add specifications for your APIs calls and customize
  the theme. Go ahead, see if we care.</p>
