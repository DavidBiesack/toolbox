name: Health Inspections
description: I created a web parser that collects health inspection information from
  the Napa County health department website, stores it as a JSON object, and prints
  the information in a user-friendly format. I also wrote a script that reads in the
  information from the JSON object and creates a MySQL schema to store the information
  in a database
