description: "Our Team is developing a Speckle plugin and interoperability transport
  schema for UE4. Our goal is to enable Revit/Dynamo and Rhino/Grasshopper to send
  + receive geometry to UE4 for visualization. Our current priority is to establish
  and release a data sender (TO UE4). We\u2019re also working on receiver methods,
  however our initial focus  is on Rhino/Grasshopper to UE4 translation and the attachment
  of UE4-specific metadata to the core JSON \u2018blobs\u2019 in transport."
