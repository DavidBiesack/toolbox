name: securing apollo federated applications
description: Security is an issue for all api's. GraphQL api's are no different. It
  is an area that requires a lot of thought and research to define a security strategy
  but when dealing with apollo federated applications additional considerations need
  to be made. I have put together my thoughts and insights on how to secure these
  systems.
