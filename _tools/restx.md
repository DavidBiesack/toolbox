name: RESTX
description: RESTX is a full lightweight disrupting stack, which includes Swagger-like ui & considers REST specs tests as docs. It shares similarities with modern frameworks like Play! like hot compile and a very productive experience, but focused on REST and pure Java. It's licensed under the very commercial friendly Apache License 2, and is actively maintained by a community of developers.
