description: Backend of an e-commerce website In this project, I have made a backend
  of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS. Here's the swagger,
  but you need to pass the test for it first here. I have also used JWT-authentication
  token to verify the if the customer is valid or not. We are already given the mysql-database
  in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries
  for different endpoints to make them working.
