description: "Built in Node.js open source server framework. In this project I moved
  from client-side development (using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) to building a server-side
  web application using the Express.js web framework hosted in Node.js runtime environment.
  The site includes a flatty style landing page including navigatation bar, sign-up
  forms, staff info etc. It has an uncluttered and minimal UI. The backend API\u2019s
  communicated with databases designed using MongoDB, an example of a NoSQL database
  program using JSON-like objects with schemas. All APIs, including GET, PUT, UPDATE
  and DELETE were tested using Postman. Great experience using PuTTY open-source terminal
  emulator, working remotely over SSH network protocol. Securing my API with authentication;
  hashing passwords using Bcrypt and issuing tokens with JSON Web Token (JWT). New
  additions help to restrict access and ensure tokens are verified. Previous to this
  the back-end APIs could be easily accessed via the URL. User comments coudl be retrieved,
  new ones saved, deleted or updated. Hashing is a means of transforming a string
  of characters (passwords, in my case) into a different and larger set of characters,
  thus protecting our sensitive data. Bcrypt is the password hashing function used."
