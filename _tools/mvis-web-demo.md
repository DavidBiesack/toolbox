description: "We created some examples and samples to showcase the functionality of
  the recently launch Rocket\xAE MultiValue Integration Server (MVIS) and to support
  its\u2019 adoption. The samples and examples demonstrate how you can use MVIS to
  build a mobile app using Flutter against the xdemo data/ account on the UniVerse
  MV Application server.   The Rocket\xAE MultiValue Integration Server (MVIS) empowers
  teams to leverage modern languages and frameworks to access MV data and business
  logic. MVIS follows a low-code/no-code model that makes it easy to unlock business
  logic and data by creating RESTful APIs and associated Swagger definitions. The
  Swagger integration provides a level of abstraction that gives developers without
  MV experience the ability to dissect it through the Swagger Editor to understand
  exactly what the API is doing. "
