name: Project Data Modeling with Postgres
description: Introduction A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've
  been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The
  analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are
  listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which
  resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory
  with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  They'd like a data engineer to create
  a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis,
  and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline
  for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running
  queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results
  with their expected results.  Project Description In this project, you'll apply
  what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using
  Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables
  for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that
  transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres
  using Python and SQL.
