description: In this project, you will work on developing REST API endpoints of various
  functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order
  to observe the functionality of the endpoints, you will use the Swagger user interface
  and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to be implemented
  using Java Persistence API (JPA).
