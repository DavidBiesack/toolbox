description: "This is the most modern and comprehensive course available for Spring
  Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.   All source code examples used in this course have
  been developed using the latest version of the Spring Framework - Spring Framework
  5 and Spring Boot 2.  In this course, you will build multiple real world applications
  using Spring Framework 5.   You will see how modern Spring Framework development
  is done by leveraging the features of Spring Boot 2.   Jump In and Build a Spring
  MVC App with Spring Boot!  We'll jump right into web development with the Spring
  Framework. I'll show you how kick off a Spring Boot project by using the Spring
  Initializr. We will then go step by step to build a simple Book / Author web application.
  \  You will see how easy it is to use Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA
  to create a functional web application running under Tomcat with a H2 in-memory
  database.  Use Test Driven Development!  In addition to teaching you Spring Framework
  5, you will learn about modern best practices used in enterprise application development.
  \  As we build the applications, you'll see me using Test Driven Development (TDD)
  with JUnit and Mockito.  Using Mockito mocks keeps your Spring Framework unit tests
  light and fast!  You'll also see how the Spring context can be used for more complex
  integration tests.  These techniques are best practices used by companies all over
  the world to build and manage large scale Spring Framework applications.  GitHub
  Source Code  You will have complete access to all source code examples used in the
  course.  In each lesson where we write code, you will have a link to GitHub with
  two branches in the Github repository.   The first branch is the starting state
  of the code.   The second branch is the ending state of the code.   You can see
  exactly what changed in each lesson. Each step of the way, you have a working example
  you can use for troubleshooting.  In fact, you will get access to 15 (and growing!)
  different GitHub repositories - each packed with Spring Framework programming examples.
  \  And, you're encouraged to fork my GitHub repositories so you can share the Spring
  Framework applications, which you built, to future employers!   Continuous Integration
  Builds  Since we are using GitHub and have great test coverage, I also show you
  how easy it is to set up Continuous Integration builds with CircleCI.   Continuous
  Integration builds are another best practice used by enterprise developers.   Using
  CircleCI makes your CI builds a snap!  Project Lombok  We all know Java development
  can require a lot of boiler plate code. It's just the nature of Java.  Would you
  like to see how to slash your boiler plate code using Project Lombok?  Spring Data
  JPA and Hibernate  Spring MVC and Hibernate have long been cornerstones of the Spring
  Framework. You will learn how to use Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to
  build a real world web application. You'll learn about Hibernate configuration,
  and about the mapping of JPA entities.   The Thymeleaf template engine is hugely
  popular with the Spring community. You will see how easy Spring Boot makes using
  Thymeleaf with Spring MVC.  While Bootstrap CSS is not a focus of the course, we
  will leverage Bootstrap CSS to make our web pages look awesome!  Spring MVC  Spring
  MVC has a lot of robust capabilities.  I start you off showing you how to build
  recipe application (using TDD, of course).   Initially, it's all happy path development.
  We go back and add custom exception handling, form validation, and internationalization.
  \ Reactive Programming  A big theme of Spring Framework 5 is Reactive Programming.
  \  Inside the course we build a web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, Spring
  Data MongoDB, and MongoDB.  We then take the MongoDB application we built and convert
  it to a Reactive application. You'll see how you can leverage the new Reactive types
  inside the Spring Framework from the data tier to the web tier.  You will get to
  see step by step how to convert a traditional Spring MVC application to an end to
  end reactive application using the WebFlux framework - which is brand new to Spring
  Framework 5.  Coming Soon to the Course  I plan to add a lot more content to this
  course!   I want this to be your go-to course for becoming a Spring Framework developer.
  \ Coming soon to the course in 2017:  Building RESTFul APIs with Spring WebFlux
  (New in Spring Framework 5!) Spring Security Documenting your APIs with RestDoc
  and Swagger 2 Aspect Oriented Programming Using Spring Events Scheduling Tasks Using
  JAXB Caching with eHcache Spring JDBC (JDBC Template) Spring RestTemplate JMS Messaging
  AMQP with RabbitMQ Logging configuration for Logback and Log4J 2 And more real world
  Spring Framework apps!   Message me if there is a topic you'd like to see!  Spring
  Framework 5 GA Release  This Spring Framework course is so new, it has been developed
  using Spring Framework 5 'Release Candidate' releases.  Spring Framework 5 went
  GA (General Availability) in September of 2017.   The Spring Boot 2.0 GA release
  is expected to be in late 2017.  All source code examples will get updated as the
  GA releases of the Spring Framework and Spring Boot become available.   Course Updates
  \ August 1, 2017 - All source code examples updated to latest release of Spring
  Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2. Now on Spring Framework 5.0 RC3 and Spring Boot 2.0.0.M3.
  August 8, 2017 - Added content for internationalization with Spring MVC. Added new
  section to course for using MySQL with Spring Boot / Spring MVC. Added CircleCI
  for CI builds. CodeCov (dot) io for test coverage reporting. August 9th, 2017 -
  Added whole new section course on Spring Data MongoDB. Learn to build a web application
  using the best of the Spring Framework!  August 25th, 2017 - Reactive Programming
  with Spring Framework 5! Almost two hours of additional content has been added on
  Reactive Programming and Reactive MongoDB. October 10th, 2017 - 3 hours of new content
  added for consuming and building RESTFul web services using Spring MVC. This includes
  using RestTemplate to consume RESTFul services, Spring 5 WebClient to consume RESTFul
  services using Reactive data types, and new lessons on using MapStruct for data
  mapping.  Course Extra - Spring Boot Cookbook!  Inside this course, I'm including
  a Spring Boot Cookbook. You will have complete examples of using the Spring Framework
  with popular open source technologies. When you get hired as a Spring Framework
  developer, you'll have ready made Spring Framework examples!  My Spring Boot Cookbook

  Framework developers. Downloads of Spring Boot are up 425% year over year, while
  Gartner Research is calling Java EE \"Obsolete\".   The market trends are clear.
  Popularity for JEE is rapidly declining.  The popularity for the Spring Framework
  is growing.   Spring Framework 5 is packed with exciting and innovative new features
  making it a natural choice for enterprise application development.  Future proof
  your programming career. Start learning how to building modern applications using
  the Spring Framework and enroll in this course today!  \xBFCu\xE1les son los requisitos?
