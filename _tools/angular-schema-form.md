description: Generate forms from JSON schemas using AngularJS! Schema Form is a set of AngularJS directives (and a couple of services). It can do two things to make life easier. Create a form directly from a JSON schema. Validate form fields against that same JSON schema. Schema Form uses convention over configuration, so it comes packaged with some sensible defaults. But you can always customize it by changing the order and types of form fields.
