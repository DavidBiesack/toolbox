name: apache httpd swagger
description: The latest version of Apache and the Swagger Editor combined in a single
  package to make working with the Swagger Editor web application easier. The Swagger
  Editor is a web application, designed to work in a web browser deployed on a server.
  The ApacheHttpdSwagger application allows you to quickly and easily create a local
  server and take advantage of native Swagger features and best practices. Some of
  these best practices are based on http requests for additional Swagger component
  files. Leveraging a component set of reusable Swagger definition files is especially
  helpful and a best practice when Swagger files start to become large. With large
  files maintenance and extension becomes a more difficult task, prone to higher risk,
  in real world application of Swagger API definition file(s).  This project aims
  to make things better, and easily leverage the best of what the Swagger Editor has
  to offer in an open source standard. Enjoy! And have a great day!
