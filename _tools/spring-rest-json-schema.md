name: spring rest json schema
description: This is a project for investigating, when private field without setter
  is contained in a constructor annotated with @JsonCreator, then the ObjectMapper
  configured by Spring Boot treats that private field deserializable, while ObjectMapper
  created by new treats that private field not deserializable. Not finished yet.
