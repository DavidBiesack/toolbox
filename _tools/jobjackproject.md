description: "1.) Develop a Node.JS api that allows a client app to:  Obtain the full
  directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem. Include the
  full path, file size and attribute information in the result and cater for a large
  directory size ( at least 100 000).  Make sure the application is containerized
  and can run on any system. You can use REST or Graphql. We are a Graphql company,
  but if you don\u2019t know it yet then I would suggest you use what you know best.
  \ 2.) Build a Angular 6 client and can call the api and display the results. It
  does not have to be fancy, you can use frameworks like bootstrap to display the
  data. ( If you do not know Angular that is fine. The documentation is really good
  and should give you the basics of what you want done really quick )  3.) Try and
  stay away from imperative style coding as much as possible. Stream is you partner."
