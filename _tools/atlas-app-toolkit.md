name: atlas app toolkit
description: This repository provides common Go utilities and helpers that are reusable
  from project-to-project. The goal is to prevent code duplication by encouraging
  teams to use and contribute to toolkit libraries.  The toolkit is not a framework.
  Rather, it is a set of (mostly gRPC-related) plugins and helpers.
