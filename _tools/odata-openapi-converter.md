name: OData OpenAPI Converter
description: "OData to OpenAPI Converter generates an interactive graphical interface
  which depicts the capabilities of an OData service as a set of individual endpoints,
  when the service root URL of an OData service is provided. This tool makes use of
  the OData services\u2019 metadata document and generates a swagger specification
  based on that. This swagger specification is finally viewed on a Swagger UI."
