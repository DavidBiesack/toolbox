description: 'I used React Native to create a fitness tracker mobile application for
  iOS and Android. In order to update and maintain server data, I used a combination
  of the RESTful API and Postman. Additionally, the Expo framework and Node.js were
  used to build the application on my machine. This app allows users to sign into
  their account to log exercise/nutritional information, create fitness goals, and
  view their progress. '
