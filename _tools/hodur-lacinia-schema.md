description: Hodur is a domain modeling approach and collection of libraries to Clojure.  By
  using Hodur you can define your domain model as data, parse and validate it, and
  then either consume your model via an API or use one of the many plugins to help
  you achieve mechanical results faster and in a purely functional manner.
