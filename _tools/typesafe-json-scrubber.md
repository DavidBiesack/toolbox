name: typesafe json scrubber
description: Define scrubbers of data of unreliable formats to ensure at run-time
  that the scrubbed data matches the specified schema/contract and type definitions.  Your
  scrubbers are also typechecked against your typescript types at design-time so that
  your scrubbers don't fall out of sync with the types they are meant to guarantee.
