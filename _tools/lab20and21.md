description: A function that will return random facts, exported from a different file.
  Converted the app to Express. Created routes to retrieve facts. Tested using Postman.
  Created a front-end for the app (added public folder, configured express app to
  point to the public folder). Used an AJAX call from the front end to retrieve the
  random facts.
