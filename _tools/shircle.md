description: "It is Android aapplication back end code made for small local businesses.
  The back end of this application is in C# .NET using MVC architecture making REST
  APIs. And all the views are on Android. I worked as a back end developer in this
  app. Back end of the app is in c# using .NET entity framework. REST APIs developed
  using Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. Views were designed on android studio.
  The database was designed by using Code First Approach. (Visual Studio, Android
  Studio, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft SQL, SQLite, Postman, Entity Framework, MVC,
  Firebase REST API\u2019s, REST API\u2019s, JSON) This app has the following features:
  I. It provides all in one business solution to shopkeepers. Shopkeeper can setup
  his online store, manage sales through mobile POS, track of inventory, sale reports
  generation, market insights, and trending products. II. On the other hand, customer
  can view nearby stores through Google Maps & Shircle-Eye, add products to virtual
  cart, and view trending items according to their interests."
