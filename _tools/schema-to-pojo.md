name: schema to pojo
description: 'The schema-to-pojo project was started because we wanted to programmatically
  generate the Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) from JSON schemas.  More specifically
  we wanted to use the generated POJOs as resources of the Synapse JSON REST web services
  API. Since we are using the POJOs as REST resources we also wanted an easy way to
  marsh instances to/from JSON.  Lastly, we also wanted to use the generated POJOs
  in our Google Web Toolkit (GWT) client-side code and server side code.  Thus the
  schema-to-pojo project was born. Learn more at the folllowing wiki:'
