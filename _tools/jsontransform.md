description: JSON (flow, REST, object) manipulation library with strong focus on preserving
  original data structure (schema). Heavily inspired with XPath and JSONPath, but
  acting rather as an on-the-fly interceptor of JSON flow communication with filtering
  and semantic restructuring support of the underlying JSON dataset
