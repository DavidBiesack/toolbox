description: 'Postman Pat became bored one night at the postal sorting office and
  to break the monotony of the nightshift, he carried out the following experiment
  with a row of mailboxes (all initially closed) in the post office. These mailboxes
  are numbered 1 through to 150, and beginning with mailbox 2, he opened the doors
  of all the even-numbered mailboxes. Next, beginning with mailbox 3, he went to every
  third mailbox, opening its door if it was closed and closing it if it was open.
  Then he repeated this procedure with every fourth door, then every fifth door, and
  so on. When he finished, he was surprised at the distribution of closed mailboxes.
  A program to determine and display which mailboxes these were (i.e. which doors
  were closed at the end of the process). '
