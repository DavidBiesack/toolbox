description: Another simple exercise to implement a full-stack realtime chat application.
  The server side is implemented using Meteor, MongoDB, and swydo:ddp-apollo to provide
  the Graphql interface. The frontend part uses React v.16, Graphql, apollo-client
  v2.2.0 with apollo-link-http to get GraphQL communication resolved over HTTP and
  subscriptions-transport-ws to get subscriptions through WebSocket.
