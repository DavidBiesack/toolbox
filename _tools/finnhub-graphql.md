name: finnhub graphql
description: A simple graphql wrapper I built around the https://finnhub.io/ API in
  a weekend. Using this project as a baseline for functionality around a code generator
  that I'm privately writing. The API token hard coded into the requests is not a
  valid token so if you pull this down, you'll have to replace it with your own token.
