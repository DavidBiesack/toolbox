description: 'This was created in response to the demand for a user friendly online
  store template.  The goal was to create it where the user has access to an online
  dashboard where they could not only change images, titles, and descriptions for
  items in their store, but even the prices where the store would dynamically update
  its checkout processes accordingly.  The store was created using a Next.js, Apollo,
  and React frontend with a GraphQL and Prisma backend. '
