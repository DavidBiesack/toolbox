description: During my internship at Hyperlab I made an application in a team of designers,
  project manager and developers. I am not allowed to show the whole application for
  security reasons. I still want to show some of my code because it has improved a
  lot since I began at Hyperlab. The main technoligies are React-native-web, Apollo,
  Graphql, Prisma and Expo
