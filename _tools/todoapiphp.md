description: "In this project, you\u2019ll create a REST API using Slim. The API will
  provide a way for users to manage a todo list: users can interact with the database
  by retrieving a list of tasks, as well as adding, updating and deleting tasks in
  the database.  To complete this project, you\u2019ll use your knowledge of REST
  API design, PHP and Slim to create API routes, along with the PDO for data modeling.
  To test your application, you'll use Postman, a popular application for exploring
  and testing REST APIs."
