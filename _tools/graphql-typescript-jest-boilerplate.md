name: graphql typescript jest boilerplate
description: I often see community complaining about testing Graph API's, So I decided
  to create this little template using apollo server and jest with Typescript! I hope
  you can use it as a base to make something just as good as you need!  The idea is
  to separate the application from the server, this way you can use supertest npm
  module to make real requests and do not need to initiate a local server!
