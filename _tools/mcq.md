  Material UI  Backend is Firebase: Firestore (NoSQL database, which is a document
  store instead of an entity store) Functions (serverless backend i.e. Node.js) AppConfig
  (A/B testing and configuration), Data (entity store / asset data) Cloudinary (image
  CDN and transforms) Hosting (static files / CDN) data transfer layer(i.e.transport
  for communication with the backend, GraphQL gradually mix in some web sockets)  Mobile
