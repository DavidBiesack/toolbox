name: pocket knife
description: pocket-knife is a RESTful, PHP web service framework. It takes care of
  the plumbing while you focus on building RESTful resources (the data schema and
  actions) and representations (the data format); of course pocket-knife already includes
  common representation types like JSON, XML, HTML as well as a handful of storage
  methods like PDO, CouchDB, and Mongo to link your resources to a database.
