description: In this project, I worked on developing REST API endpoints of various
  functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order
  to observe the functionality of the endpoints, I have used the Swagger user interface
  and stored the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to been implemented
  using Java Persistence API (JPA).
