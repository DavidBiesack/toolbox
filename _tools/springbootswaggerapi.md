description: A Spring Boot example app which showcases the way REST endpoints can
  be exposed using Springfox Swagger UI, in order to allow users to perform CRUD operations
  on a remote MySQL database. DTOs are used in order to encapsulate certain aspects
  of the data which is sent/received. The Tomcat server is embedded into Spring Boot.
