name: FoodOrderingApp Backend
description: In this project, we will be developing from scratch REST API endpoints
  of various functionalities required for the web app FoodOrderingApp. In order to
  observe the functionalities of the endpoints, we will create the FoodOrderingApp
  UI using React to interact with and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. In
  order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, we will use the Swagger user
  interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to
  be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
