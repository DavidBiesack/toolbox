name: Quantitative Contest
description: 'It''s an experience in a quantitative contest. We are a team of three
  members and got first in the Round 3 period in both PnL and Sharpe Ratio.  First,
  the virtual trading system uses Google''s gRPC framework. So we wrote scripts to
  send commands such as orders to this system.  Second, we conducted scripts to request
  virtual market data from this system.  Third, we built a data processing class to
  deal with raw data and make it feasible and standard.  Fourth, we wrote separately
  three high frequency models: RBreaker, Timeselecting( cf my first internship), Dual
  Thrust strategy.  Fifth, we wrote a python file to help control the risk in our
  tradings.'
