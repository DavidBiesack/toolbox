description: GoRcon is an abstraction layer to map common rcon functionality from
  various games to a unified api (grpc/rest) while also providing local management
  functionality to make running game servers easier. This allows the use as a rcon
  connector for both client tools and cloud solutions like the PlayNet BanList.
