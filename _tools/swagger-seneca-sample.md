description: 'A sample API facade with Seneca microservices that showcase the Swagger-seneca-router
  module. Swagger-seneca-router is a Node.js connect/express middleware for routing
  REST API calls to Seneca micro-services. The idea is that you only have to work
  at the schema level in Swagger and the business logic level in Seneca. None of that
  dealing with boiler plate code! '
