description: "** This assignment will combine a few things that you have learned in
  this class and will require a little learning on your own. Do your best and be creative.
  \ If you need help ask sooner rather than later in slack. Myself and your classmates
  are here to help and do not wait to the last minute to do this assignment. ** You
  may work in two person teams, if you plan to do so please email me to let me know
  who you are working with. You may NOT work in multiple teams. ** You may use python,
  JAVA or node.js (javascript) for this assignment. ** I have listed some tutorials
  below, but you may need to google some on your own.    What You Will Do: You will
  create a RESTful web service that runs in a docker container. Your web service will
  contain two GET routes: One that displays a collection of records One that displays
  a single record that the corresponds to an ID Example: If I created two routes,
  /customers and /customers/35 (note, that 35 is the ID of a given customer in my
  database) The data returned from your web service routes must be in JSON or XML
  form. Note, if you would like to load your results in a web page you are welcome
  to do so, you just need a way to display the data your routes return in a web browser.
  You will create a hardcoded JSON file based database as the backing datastore for
  your web service routes. Note, if you are comfortable using a SQL or NO-SQL database
  as your datastore you may do so but it is not required. Also note, your data model
  is something you make up. Meaning you can store a collection of cars, customers,
  food items, restaurants, video games, sports teams etc. Be creative :) This is similar
  to what the presenter did in the GraphQL video we watched in our last class. He
  used a JSON file as a database for his demo. You will have to present your work
  to the class, with a live demo or video you recorded of you running your web service
  from own computer.  This is not optional!    Tutorials: Docker What is docker:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz5_lsWlfTU

  (Read Carefully): ** Please follow all instructions as not following them will lead
  to loss of points. Create a github account. Create public github repository and
  all all of your source code for this assignment to the repository. (See the \u201Cgetting
  started with github\u201D document in the \u201CCourse Documents  > Tutorials &
  Cheat Sheets\u201D folder for help) Make sure to add a README file to the root of
  your repository that describes what your web service does. Create a presentation
  powerpoint slide deck that contains 2 slides: A title slides that contains your
  name(s) and the name of your web service project A slide that talks a little about
  your data model Submit the following to the \u201CSubmit Assignment\u201D thread
  in RESTful Web Service Implementation + Docker discussion board. The powerpoint
  slide file. Link to your public github repository that contains all of the source
  code including your JSON database file. Note, if you worked with classmate for this
  assignment...if you did please state the person you worked with."
