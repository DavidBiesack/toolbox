description: Decided to write a tech blog/personal profile page on a monthly basis
  to share knowledge and refresh memory. Also because I found a very cool sketch design
  that I want to code. Frontend using React, Sass and React-router, backend using
  GraphQL and DatoCMS. Completely open-sourced.
