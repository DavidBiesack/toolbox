name: CRUD App
description: 'I made a Crud App using Node.js,Express.js and Mongoose.js. I built
  out a book Schema for creating,reading,updating and deleting books.  Used Express
  Scripts to create routes that will form the basis for a restful API.  Used POSTMAN
  to perform actions on the routes All the book details were altered as JSON objects.
  I created and used Google Chrome to confirm the changes made on the local host server
  port 8080. '
