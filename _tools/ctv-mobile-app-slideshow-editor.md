name: CTV Mobile App Slideshow Editor
description: 'Uses a modified version of jdorn/json-editor: JSON Schema Based Editor.
  By making the editor read and write to separate file, the editor is able to modify
  JSON content for the CTV mobile app. The editor is modified to allow the use of
  uploaded image files. The file paths to the images are encoded in JSON for the mobile
  app as well. The actual code is contained in the upload.php and upload.html files,
  and the examples/basic.html file.'
