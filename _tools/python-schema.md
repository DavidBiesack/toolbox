name: python schema
description: 'Agnostic schema (yes, another one) that was inspired by following libs:
  JSON Schema, marshmallow, WTForms, schema (https://pypi.org/project/schema/). Primary
  goal is simplicity, python-schema talks only dictionaries, does not understand methods,
  built-in validation is rudimentary (however extendable), while it supports various
  nesting and full customisation of which field is required and which is not.'
