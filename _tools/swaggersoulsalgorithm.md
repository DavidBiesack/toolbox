description: 'Quick algorithm which scans all possible urls within Swaggers parameters.
  If more people run it, we will find it faster as it is randomised. Please tell me
  if something is wrong that I missed. UPDATE: Have just added a version which should
  have no repeating URLs so it is more effective. It also only has 15 of each letter
  as that is what SwaggerSouls said was in the URL.'
