name: Project Yelp Dataset
description: "Part 1 - Download the Yelp dataset from Camino. Look at each JSON file
  and understand what information the JSON objects provide. Pay attention to the data
  items in JSON objects that you will need for your application (For example, categories,attributes,...etc.)
  - You may have to modify your database design from Homework 2 to model the database
  for the described application scenario on page-1. Your database schema doesn\u2019t
  necessarily need to include all the data items provided in the JSON files. Your
  schema should be precise but yet complete. It should be designed in sucha way that
  all queries/data retrievals on/from the database run efficiently and effectively.
  - Produce DDL SQL statements for creating the corresponding tables in a relational
  DBMS. Note the constraints, including key constraints, referential integrity constraints,
  not NULL constraints, etc. needed for the relational schema to capture and enforce
  the semantics of your ER design. - Populate your database with the Yelp data. Generate
  INSERT statements for your tables and run those to insert data into your DB. II.
  Part 2 Implement the application for searching local businesses as explained in
  section \u201COverview & Requirements\u201D. In this milestone you would: - Write
  the SQL queries to search your database. - Establish connectivity with the DBMS.
  - Embed/execute queries in/from the code. Retrieve query results and parse the returned
  results to generate the output that will be displayed on the GUI. - Implement a
  GUI where the user can, o browse through main and sub-categories for the businesses;
  select the business categories that user wants to search for; (note: The list of
  the main categories is given in Appendix-C. All other categories that appear in
  the business objects are sub-categories. Such a distinction is made for easier browsing
  of the business categories.) o browse through theattributes of theselected categories
  ;specify the attributes she/he is interested in; o search for the businesses that
  belong to the main and sub-categories that user specifies and have the attributes
  that user selects, (The user should be able to search for the businesses that have
  either all the attributes (AND condition) or that have any of the attributes specified
  (ORcondition)) o filteroutthesearchresultsforaspecificstate,city,orzipcode, o filteroutthebusinesseswhichareopenorclosedonspecificdaysoftheweek,
  o selectacertainbusinessinthesearchresultsandlistallthereviewsforthatbusiness.(note:The
  review list should also include the names of the users who provided thosereviews)"
