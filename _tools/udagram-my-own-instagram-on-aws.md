name: Udagram my own instagram on AWS
description: My edit of Udacity's Udagram image filtering microservice. This is also
  my project submission as part of my cloud Developer Nanodegree. Udagram is a simple
  cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree.
  It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed,
  and process photos using an image filtering microservice.
