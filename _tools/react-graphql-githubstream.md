description: "There are a bunch of APIs available for all sorts of data. Many things
  today are written as single-page applications (SPA) using \u201Cweb technologies\u201D.
  They are today available as webpages or even downloadable applications.  For those
  who code for a living, an API is as much of a UI as anything with shapes and colors.
  However, we would like to create a user interface that will display the result of
  an API-call in an way thats approachable for a non-coder."
