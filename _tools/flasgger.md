name: Flasgger
description: lasgger is a Flask extension to extract OpenAPI-Specification from all
  Flask views registered in your API.  Flasgger also comes with SwaggerUI embedded
  so you can access http://localhost:5000/apidocs and visualize and interact with
  your API resources.  Flasgger also provides validation of the incoming data, using
  the same specification it can validates if the data received as as a POST, PUT,
  PATCH is valid against the schema defined using YAML, Python dictionaries or Marshmallow
  Schemas.  Flasgger can work with simple function views or MethodViews using docstring
  as specification, or using @swag_from decorator to get specification from YAML or
  dict and also provides SwaggerView which can use Marshmallow Schemas as specification.  Flasgger
  is compatible with Flask-RESTful so you can use Resources and swag specifications
  together, take a look at restful example.  Flasgger also supports Marshmallow APISpec
  as base template for specification, if you are using APISPec from Marshmallow take
  a look at apispec example.
