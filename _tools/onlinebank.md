description: Online Bank application is based on Spring Boot and Hibernate to create
  backend side and Angular 7 to create frontend side. To test backend side I used
  JUnit 5. Additionally for documentation I used Swagger. This project simulate what
  client can do after login to bank account. Additionally admin can manage all created
  accounts.
