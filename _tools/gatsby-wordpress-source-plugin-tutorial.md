name: gatsby wordpress source plugin tutorial
description: Working through this tutorial from the Gatsby docs as I'm trying to get
  a better handle on how to utilize a remote resource for page data. Gatsby provides
  a simple process for programmatically creating pages using GraphQL, however, a few
  of Gatsby's most powerful plugins are set up to work with this data locally by default.
  Learning how to set up a local GraphQL schema of nodes from a remote data source
  will be helpful in extending Gatsby's capabilities for generating highly-performant,
  powerful sites.
