name: serverless lambdaless apigateway dynamodb
description: In this repo, I loose the Lambda altogether and have API Gateway directly
  invoke DynamoDB, to create a full suite of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
  operations. Other posts I've read only cover how to partially do this manually in
  the AWS console and not in code using Swagger and SAM, which is what I will show
  you here. Using Swagger and SAM to deploy the infrastructure and API is realistically
  what you absolutely want to do to release it to a production environment for minimising
  human error, repeatability and scalability.
