description: 'Start exploring the APIs right away with this fully-functional application
  that works right out of the box. Using your browser, you can get started with running
  any GET request to see how data is returned; try more advanced calls (creating and
  updating information) by pointing your preferred API console at it (e.g., Postman
  or Fiddler). You will need a key and sandbox prior to using it, available through
  the PDN website. '
