description: "In this video, you\u2019ll learn the basics of Alexa Skill development
  by building one. But first, an introductory to Alexa Skills would be great. Alexa
  is Amazon\u2019s Voice Service, accessed through Amazon Echo. After the setup process,
  you simply say the word \u2018Alexa\u2019, Echo will light up, and Alexa will respond.
  Alexa Skills are like apps. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. In other
  words, Skills are the interface between users and Alexa. We\u2019ll handle the Alexa
  Skill development process under 3 parts. 1st part will be about signing in to Amazon
  Web Services (AWS) and creating a function and at 2nd part, we\u2019ll use the Amazon
  Development Portal to configure our skill. 3rd part will be a short test of our
  skill. You\u2019ll end with a simple but complete Alexa skill that can run on Amazon
  Echo or any device with Alexa. This tutorial uses the Alexa Skills Kit, AWS Lambda,
  and Python. Part 1 * Sign in to AWS Management Console, if you don\u2019t have any
  account then you can create a free account. From the list of services, select Lambda.
  * Click the region drop-down in the upper-right corner of the console and select
  US East (N. Virginia), which is a supported region for Lambda functions used with
  the Alexa Skills Kit. * Choose to Create a Function to choose a blueprint for your
  new function * In the search filter box, type Alexa. Select blueprint Alexa-skills-kit-color-expert-python
  from the results. * Name your function. We\u2019ll use conversation. Then, under
  the Lambda function handler and role, select the Create a custom role option. *
  When the IAM role management console opens, click on the Allow to go back to the
  previous Lambda console. * Scroll down and click on Create Function. * Copy the
  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) displayed in the upper-right corner of the console that
  starts with arn:aws:lambda:us-east\u2026. Part 2 * Sign in to Amazon Development
  Portal, if you don\u2019t have any account then you can create a free account. *
  Go to Create a New Alexa Skill page * Name your skill.  * Click Next to continue
  to develop * In the Intent Schema box, paste the JSON code."
