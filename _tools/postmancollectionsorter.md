name: PostmanCollectionSorter
description: Cmd line app to sort the requests within Postman collections to match
  the order object. Postman randomly shuffles requests when outputting collections
  in order to make source control difficult even with minor changes. If this is run
  before each update to a collection, it allows you to see incremental changes to
  each version in history instead of the entire collection being shuffled.
