name: springboot rest image retriever
description: A spring boot application that uses REST to retrieve an image. Images
  are currently saved in the directory resources/images for convenience. Best practice
  would be to save it to a file system. Call any of the endpoints with a program of
  your choice, I used Postman. e.g. GET -> http://localhost:8080/images/abcd.png
