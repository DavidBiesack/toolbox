description: "YouTube has been collecting data on their video streaming and the activities
  of user. They have recently shown their interest in the proper analysis of this
  data. The most important thing what they want to know is \u201Cwhat videos are users
  most interested in?\u201D For the time being they have been following a very difficult
  way to query their data. 1- They have directories of JSON log files for the user
  activities. 2- They have a directory that contains Metadata of these videos in form
  of JSON files. We want you build a PostgreSQL database for performing a good Play
  Analysis of these videos. You will be doing the following things, 1- Optimization
  of tables by following a star schema (using fact and dimension tables) so that we
  can run queries. 2- Creating a database schema of these optimized tables and writing
  an ETL (Extract Transform and Load) layer to load data from JSON log files to this
  database."
