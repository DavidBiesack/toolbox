description: Help you name your JAV library directories to keep things organized.
  The webapp version. This is an educational project. Be warned there are numerous
  NSFW words in this application and shouldn't be viewed or shared in polite company.
  But if you're a noobie like me who wants to see how one would go about combining
  ReactJS, Semantic UI React, NodeJS, GraphQL, Apollo Client, and Prisma, well, you're
  welcome to look at my first attempt at it!
