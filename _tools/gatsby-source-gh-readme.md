description: 'This GatsbyJS plugin queries GitHub''s GraphQL API. It fetches the README.md
  file contents on the master branch of each repository and creates nodes in GatsbyJS
  which can be queried using GraphQL. Because the mime type for the content of these
  nodes is set to ''text/markdown'' they are further processed into MarkdownRemark
  nodes. '
