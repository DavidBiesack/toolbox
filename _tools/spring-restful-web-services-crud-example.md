name: spring restful web services crud example
description: 'DESCRIPTION:  This project represents a base Spring 4 legacy project
  for Spring MVC / REST services.  The REST services are handled / tested by index.html.  This
  is done so you can see an example of how to call all of the CRUD  functions from
  a web page.  Most projects do not make the calls from a web page but from POSTMAN
  or even from a  test function which does you no good if you are trying to figure
  out how to do call from a webpage.  Dependencies ------------ Maven 3.1 Java 8 Spring
  4 Spring MVC 4 Jackson Databind javax.servlet-api 3.1'
