description: Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for back-end development. When
  combined with express, you can create lightweight, fast, scalable APIs quickly and
  simply. which will walk through how to stand up a lightweight Express server serving
  truly RESTful services using Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. We will implement all
  of the RESTful verbs to get, add, and update data from our service. We will also
  spend some time working through unit and end to end integration tests for our services.
