name: advanced serializer usage
description: "This code is to show how we can do one of the advanced serializer usages
  called Dynamically modification fields. Dynamic modifying fields can make a Django
  rest framework API act like graphQL endpoint by retrieving only the required fields
  from the model, which is our primary goal for this article.\_ Once a serializer
  has been initialized, the dictionary of fields that are set on the serializer may
  be accessed using the\_.fieldsattribute. Accessing and modifying this attribute
  allows you to dynamically modify the serializer. Modifying the fields argument directly
  allows you to do interesting things such as changing the arguments on serializer
  fields at runtime, rather than at the point of declaring the serializer. The example
  we are using to demonstrate dynamically modifying fields will have a Book model
  which has Publisher and Author as foreign relations."
