description: JsonApiFramework is a fast, extensible, and portable .NET framework for
  the reading and writing of JSON API documents. Currently working on ApiFramework
  1.0 which is a new framework that supports the many enhancements documented in the
  2.0 milestone of this project while being media type agnostic but will support media
  types like {json:api} and GraphQL for serialization/deserialization purposes.
