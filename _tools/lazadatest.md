description: 'Using one of modern PHP frameworks (sf2, zf2, Laravel, Yii2) you should
  implement system  for API calls (no frontend part but you can add Swagger or similar
  tool to explore your api).  Your JSON-REST full api (not JSON-RPC) should provide
  CRUD access to two resources  without any security check:  ?  Post (with fields
  like: title, body and so on)  ?  Tags (with only name field) many-to-may relation
  with posts    Additional methods for API:  ?  select all posts by tag or tags  ?  count
  posts by tag or tags    After any post created system should send email to specified
  in configuration file Email.   After any post removed system should log information
  about it. '
