name: from rails to node sequlize graphql
description: 'Moving from Rails to Node is fairly straight forward. Both ecosystems
  are mature. But one feature I really enjoyed in Rails was DB migrations. I found
  two contenders: Prisma and Sequelize. I found Prisma a bit top-heavy for my needs.
  Sequelize seems to be right-sized for my current projects.'
