                        <p>When Postman joined the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) in 2020 we made a commitment to ramp up our support of the OpenAPI specification. As part of our understanding of the API landscape we also realize that the all of the leading API specifications were in need of investment as well. To help us better understand the growing landscape of API specifications we started the API Specification Toolbox, which is a community effort to increase demand and awarness of API specifications and the services and tooling that support them.</p>
												<p>This API Specification Toolbox is the result of several months of discussion arouind what is needed to drive more discussion around API specifications, running 100% on GitHub. If there is a specification, news story, service, tooling, exestion, video, or blog post you'd like to see here, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/toolbox">submit a pull request on the Github repository behind this site</a>. If you aren't comfortable submitting a PR, feel free to also <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/toolbox/issues">submit a Github issue with any feedback</a> about the project or anything published here. We look forward to working with you helping define the API specification landscape.</p>
