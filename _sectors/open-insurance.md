description: <p><span>We provide thought leadership on key issues that define interoperability
  and compatibility through the use of common and open standards.&nbsp;<span>Every
  project has a beginning! It all started with a vision for accelerated adoption of
  innovative new technologies and deeper integration with InsurTech startups which
  was translated into the first ever Open Insurance white paper.&nbsp;</span></span>Data
  is valuable to the consumer, to the companies that own it and to the firms that
  apply their technologies to it. We aim to provide the InsurTech community, developers
  and a multitude of third parties the capacity to securely integrate their applications
  with insurers data through open APIs. Insurers will more readily be able to experiment,
  collaborate and leverage innovative solutions and business models. The overarching
  emphasis of this initiative is the development of ever more sophisticated utilities
  providing customers with transformative experience through cheaper and highly accessible
  products.</p>
