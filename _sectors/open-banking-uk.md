  information. It opens the way to new products and services that could help customers
  and small to medium-sized businesses get a better deal. It could also give you a
  more detailed understanding of your accounts, and help you find new ways to make
  the most of your money. Get ready for a world of apps and websites, where you can
  choose new financial products and services from providers regulated by the Financial
  Conduct Authority (FCA) and European equivalents.</p>
