name: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
description: <p>Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. As patients
  move around the healthcare ecosystem, their electronic health records must be available,
  discoverable, and understandable. Further, to support automated clinical decision
  support and other machine-based processing, the data must also be structured and
  standardized. (See Coming digital challenges in healthcare) HL7  has been addressing
  these challenges by producing healthcare data exchange and information modeling
  standards for over 20 years. FHIR is a new specification based on emerging industry
  approaches, but informed by years of lessons around requirements, successes and
  challenges gained through defining and implementing HL7 v2 , HL7 v3  and the RIM,
  and CDA . FHIR can be used as a stand-alone data exchange standard, but can and
  will also be used in partnership with existing widely used standards. FHIR aims
  to simplify implementation without sacrificing information integrity. It leverages
  existing logical and theoretical models to provide a consistent, easy to implement,
  and rigorous mechanism for exchanging data between healthcare applications. FHIR
  has built-in mechanisms for traceability to the HL7 RIM and other important content
  models. This ensures alignment to HL7's previously defined patterns and best practices
  without requiring the implementer to have intimate knowledge of the RIM or any HL7
  v3  derivations.</p>
