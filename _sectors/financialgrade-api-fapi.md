name: Financial-grade API (FAPI)
description: <p>In many cases, Fintech services such as aggregation services use screen
  scraping and stores user passwords. This model is both brittle and insecure. To
  cope with the brittleness, it should utilize an API model with structured data and
  to cope with insecurity, it should utilize a token model such as OAuth [RFC6749,
  RFC6750]. This working group aims to rectify the situation by developing a REST/JSON
  model protected by OAuth. Specifically, the FAPI WG aims to provide JSON data schemas,
  security and privacy recommendations and protocols to enable applications to utilize
  the data stored in the financial account, enable applications to interact with the
  financial account, and enable users to control security and privacy settings. Both
  commercial and investment banking account as well as insurance, and credit card
  accounts are to be considered.</p>
