<p><em>Request to the community! Please review RC1, implement it, and share with us your feedback by November 8th. The final version should come shortly after that.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases/tag/3.1.0-rc1">Release candidate 1 (RC1) of OpenAPI Specification 3.1</a>, the Implementer&rsquo;s Draft, is available for testing and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enhancements address some of the most requested features from the OpenAPI developer community. Specifically, the OpenAPI Specification is now fully compatible with the latest draft of JSON Schema. This has been a significant effort between the OpenAPI developer community and the members of the JSON Schema community.&nbsp;</p>
