<p><span>Bangkok &ndash; 14 Dec 2020</span>: Sequoia-backed cross-chain data oracle&nbsp;<a href="https://bandprotocol.com/">Band Protocol</a>, has joined the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI Initiative</a>&nbsp;as the first blockchain firm alongside Google, eBay and Microsoft, to connect blockchain applications to common Application Programming Interfaces (API) and streamline the exchange of data between smart contracts and off-chain data sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our mission is to define a common API standard for blockchain applications by collaborating with prestigious partners to bridge the gap between centralized data, APIs and smart contracts on the blockchain,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Soravis Srinawakoon, CEO and Co-Founder of Band Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An API is a software intermediary that makes it possible for two applications to share information easily and efficiently to enhance accessibility and user experience.&nbsp;</p>
