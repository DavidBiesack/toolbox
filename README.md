# The API Specification Toolbox
This is a project to try and define the world of API specifications. The goal is to try and map out all of the different API specifications in use, as well as the services, tooling, extensions, and other supporting elements.

Feel free to submit a PR to add any specification, news, services, tools, videos, or blog post, or submit a GitHub issue asking any question and provide feedback.
