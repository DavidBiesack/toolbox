name: Certificate Transparency
description: <p>Google's Certificate Transparency project fixes several structural
  flaws in the SSL certificate system, which is the main cryptographic system that
  underlies all HTTPS connections. These flaws weaken the reliability and effectiveness
  of encrypted Internet connections and can compromise critical TLS/SSL mechanisms,
  including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and the chains of trust set
  up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked, these flaws can facilitate a wide
  range of security attacks, such as website spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle
  attacks.</p>
