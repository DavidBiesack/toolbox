description: <p>As network and service operators and developers, we&rsquo;ve spent
  our entire professional lives designing and running large-scale networks and CDNs.
  With decades of experience, we know the shortcomings of available tools. What we
  always wanted &mdash; but never found &mdash; was an infrastructure visibility solution
  that&rsquo;s scalable, powerful, easy to use, and affordable. We started Kentik
  to create that solution.</p>
