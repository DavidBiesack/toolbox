name: AWS EC2 Container Registry Service
description: <p><span>Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed&nbsp;</span><a
  href="https://aws.amazon.com/docker/">Docker</a><span>&nbsp;container registry that
  makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
  Amazon ECR is integrated with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon
  EC2 Container Service (ECS)</a><span>, simplifying your development to production
  workflow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories
  or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Amazon ECR hosts your images
  in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy
  containers for your applications. Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) provides resource-level control of each repository. With Amazon ECR, there
  are no upfront fees or commitments. You pay only for the amount of data you store
  in your repositories and data transferred to the Internet.</span></p>
