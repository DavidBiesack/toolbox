description: <p>The Reaktivity Project uses shared memory streams to directly communicate
  between each different layer in the application stack, including both the networking
  protocols and the microservices logic. Parallel execution of each layer in the application
  stack takes full advantage of the available CPU cores to maximize throughput with
  predictably low latency.</p>
