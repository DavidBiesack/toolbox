name: The Augmented API Design Reviewer
description: API Design Reviews can be a total nightmare when it comes to check API Design Guidelines conformance. Hopefully, this can be automated using the OpenAPI Specification and Spectral, a JSON/YAML lintern and so you'll be able to focus on other more interesting tasks. But that will only work if you know how to build and use Spectral rulesets. During this session you'll discover the basics of Spectral and how to actually use it at scale.
