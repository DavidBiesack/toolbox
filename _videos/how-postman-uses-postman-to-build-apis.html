name: How Postman Uses Postman to Build APIs
description: Postman has grown from a side project into a billion-dollar startup. One way their engineers have stayed ahead of their 11 million users, is by dogfooding their own tech. Learn how the engineering team uses Postman collections to build their own private APIs. While the Postman collection is not a specification description format, the Postman engineering team uses them like one. At Postman, collections are used to design, develop, and validate their APIs within a microservice architecture. Hear about the challenges the Postman engineering team faces using Postman throughout the API development lifecycle.
