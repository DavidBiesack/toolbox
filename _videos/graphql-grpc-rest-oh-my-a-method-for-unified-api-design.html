name: GraphQL, gRPC and REST, Oh My! A Method for Unified API Design
description: As APIs are adopted in more and more organizations, the need for successful API design and implementation becomes more pressing. Companies that adopt a single API definition format (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Schema Definition Language, Protobuff, etc.) are likely to find their options limited as their API ecosystem grows and matures over time. In order to avoid forcing the entire company to adopt a single API style or format, no matter the requirements of providers and consumers, we need a unified API design process. One that doesn't pre-determine implementation details such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and others. Based on materials in Amundsen's book "Design and Build Great Web APIs", this talk describes a simple, repeatable process for API designers to capture and document design details in a way that allows API developers to make their own decisions on which API style best fits the needs of the company and the consumer. Whether you are responsible for API architecture, design, implementation, or support, this talk provides valuable information on how you can improve the quality of your APIs from start to finish.
