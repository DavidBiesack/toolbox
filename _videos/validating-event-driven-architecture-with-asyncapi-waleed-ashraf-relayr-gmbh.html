name: Validating Event Driven Architecture (EDA) with AsyncAPI - Waleed Ashraf, relayr GmbH
description: AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative to provide a specification for EDA through AsyncAPI. It is based on the open-api initiative which also comes under the Linux Foundation. At relayr Gmbh, we started using AsyncAPI for Kafka message validations. So, this talk is about what we learned with our experience and how you can easily and effectively integrate the specification in your system.
